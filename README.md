## Be concise

In all interactions, plans, and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
Prefer code snippets or structured examples over prose.

## Ask for clarification

When planning, if anything is unclear ask me any clarifying questions before proceeding.

## Code comments

Be judicious with code comments. Only use comments for tricky & complex pieces of code.
